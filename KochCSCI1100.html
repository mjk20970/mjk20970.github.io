<h1 style="text-align:center;">Home Court Advantage Analysis</h1>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">A look at the effect of teams playing within their own arenas</h3>
<p>It is common knowledge that a team is considered to have an advantage when playing on its own court, as opposed to traveling long distances to play in unfamiliar territory and facing the hostility of opposing fans and a team playing on its own home court. While the overall skill of teams will vary, the trend of teams performing better at Home and underperforming while Away is quite apparent.</p>
<p>Unlike the <abbr title="Major League Baseball">MLB</abbr>, in which stadiums are different lengths, or the <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr>, where games can be played inside or outside, there are <em>no differences in the 30 different <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr> courts</em>, except for flooring patterns and the Team and Sponsor logos. All baskets are the same height, the Free Throw and 3-Point lines are all equidistant, and the courts are exactly the same length and width. This means that variation in a team's performance when at Home or on the road are attributed to aspects that do not directly affect the game.</p>
<p>Below is a table that identifies a teams overall season performance, as well as their performances for Home and Away games. I selected the Miami Heat and Charlotte Hornets because they are my home teams, and their performance was of interest to me. The Golden State Warriors and Brooklyn Nets were selected because they were the best and worst teams in the league, respectively. The Denver Nuggets were chosen because of a hypothesis I had: because the air in Denver is much thinner than any other NBA city, I believe that Denver's players would have an inherent advantage over their opponents due to spending most of their time there and having become acclimated to this condition. The results are shown below:</p>

<p>It seems that regardless of whether you are the best, worst or even a random team in your respective league, there is an inherent advantage to playing on your own home court. The Brooklyn Nets were the only team analyzed to score less at home than on the road, but these anomalies can be expected from the team with the worst record in the NBA. A segment in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkqowzcoonI">Sports Science video</a> explains explains the effect of home court advantage on free throw shooting. This is a shot that is not allowed to be defended, but that doesn't stop fans from making an impact. Players in an away game will shoot a lower percentage on their free throws, even though they are uncontested, due to the effects of crowd distractions. These same fans know to not distract their team when they are shooting free throws. </p>
<p> Although, just because you are playing at home doesn't mean that luck is always on your side. </p>
